White	Male	I actually left the climbing industry after 12 years last August. Information listed is from 2019. Right before I left, they offered  me a $5000/year raise (first raise offer in three years with that gym). They recruited me from a gym in TX where I was  assistant head coach. I made the same salary as head coach in a HCOL area (so really, I was making less) as I did as an  assistant coach in a much lower COL area. I’m filling this survey out because my info is recent enough. P.S I’m back in  TX now and was offered a director of coaching position (that I did not apply for) when I first moved back. I didn’t accept  so we never discussed salary but the owner joked, “We’ll create the position for the right person, which we think you are,  but don’t think you’re gonna be making $65,000/year or anything like that” so I have no doubt that job would’ve been  underpaid for the duties/experience/responsibilities as well. If it’s relevant to your salary survey, I have a BS in geology.

Sexism	White	Female	I've worked at a few different gyms as desk staff, coach, instructor, assistant manager, marketing, route setting... you name it.  Some were small chains with a few locations and some big chains with a lot of locations.   Out of everywhere I have worked I have found that the places where I felt most respected and valued were the smaller chains.  The big drawback I have found working for small chains is that they are typically unable or unwilling to offer any benefits outside  of a gym membership and pro deals and tend to try and keep as many staff as possible working part time so they aren't required  to offer any health insurance.  It's kind of a bummer that to be felt like I am being respected in my workplace I need to forgo working for a company that will offer  me paid vacation, health insurance, a 401k.  In addition to that, as a woman, I have had male managers (at bigger chains) become combative with me for asking questions  about policies or clarification about a task that has been asked of me. I have found that small chains tend to be much more open  to teaching skills (such as route setting, coaching, management skills, etc.) and encourage questions instead of putting each  employee in a box where they are expected to already know everything.

(Was $7.25 in 2014 when  I started at $9.50). All USD	No	It depended on the summer. I always was  fine with the pay but sometimes the hours  sucked. My second summer I worked 50  hours a week sometimes as a part time  employee, overtime only happened if you  worked more than 80 hours over the 2 week  pay period (which I’m not sure is legal). Also  the camper to staff ratio sucked the first  summer (rarely sucked the other summers)	One time staff ratio got messed up, so i was responsible for 30  6-9 year old day camp kids by myself. But I wasn’t the only  staff in the gym so other staff helped watch my campers  that afternoon.	No	White	Female	We got a free membership and pro-deals. Overall, good summer job for me. I marked part time because  that is what the gym considered me even though I would only work in the summer and quit every fall.  (I went to college 9 hours away). Made a lot of friends and gained a lot of useful skills. I didn’t get a  lot of the official instruction (on guiding, coaching, etc) beyond desk staff just because they always  knew I would be leaving in 3 months. I never considered it becoming a long term/full time career  which might have changed how I felt about it otherwise.

Most fellow coworkers were  fine. Management was the issue. 	Hispanic	Transmasc	My gym (like many) was white cis male dominated, the toxic behaviours were very clear. They continued  to build new gyms yet claimed they could not afford to pay staff more yet claimed they were doing the  best they could. I was never allowed to play music in Spanish unless it was one song in between white  boy music. I got in trouble and got nearly fired for making the same mistakes my white co-workers did -  they did not have the same talks. I was told by a manager to "grow some balls" when I was having rope  trouble on a route when we happened to be climbing outdoors (he mistook my rope trouble for being  scared but regardless even if I was scared that's no way to talk to someone). It was very typical and visibly  the same as is seen in many places in the outdoor industry. My only raise was from 9.25 to $10 even tho  I was front desk key holder , instructor of intro classes, cleaned the whole gym, belayer for parties and  groups, finder of belayer for parties, supposedly had to find people who would be good employees for  parties (I'm not HR) , substitute youth coach/ coach for seasonal camps). I was the only latin@ the whole  time during my year of working there. While management got better at hiring queers near my end, they still  hired predominantly white cis men . One time they banned the use of the word "queer" by staff. We said  screw that (we being the queer staff). Management made inppropriate jokes about women. Management  was fine when a desk staff would make inappropriate jokes about women. I thought I would enjoy it at first  but now I know that unless I work exclusively with BIPOC I will not be working in the climbing industry  again. Management frequently incorrectly paid new hires. Management frequently delayed raises on paper  (after stating someone was given a raise) and payroll corrections. One time management raised belayer pay  to $10/hr then the next week dropped it back down (I believe to 8.50/hr the original base pay for just belaying)  without notice to anyone. Extremely illegal but the raise was never on paper which is why it wasnt illegal.  Thanks for making this!

Management  of most local ‘institutions’ are often from an older generation of climbers who don’t see the importance of  inclusivity and employee retention. As a result, we see consistent turnover from passionate climbers who  can’t handle the company’s stance on partnering with organizations such as PHLASH and  Brothers of  Climbing or providing opportunities for Underrepresented communities to get involved in climbing such as  scholarships for youth programs.

Middle eastern	Male	Routesetting is skilled labor, at unskilled wages. Our gym would have salaried setters and hourly folks working at the same time,  which caused our days to end early. This negatively affected all the hourly setters having them lose about a day of work over the  course of a week.

As many ppl i was excited to be given the  opportunity to do such an awesome activity as my job. Little did I know the toll that the job would have on my body. I experienced  various small injuries that after a while add up and take my own personal time from climbing for my own enjoyment.   The current pace of work has been changed to a more accommodating pace due to covid. I believe management has been very  fair to me and its trying to add more benefits to the job.  Unfortunately, I think the industry loves to encourage the dirtbag lifestyle narrative and that routesetters are lucky to be given the  chance to do the job we do, when the reality is that training of an apprentice routesetter takes 6 months to a year, maybe even  two for a routesetter to be able to be well versed in both commercial and competitive setting. I hope to see more routesetters to  openly discuss their wages and push for a more appropriate compensation for the skilled labor we provide

Our salaries are kept so low that the general  managers often leave before finishing a year or two, and it’s not a manageable salary for anyone who’s not recently out of  school, has limited expenses/no family dependents, and is passionate enough about climbing to stick around. I’ve seen the  numbers for the gym and know that there’s not mountains of cash being hoarded by the ownership, but I wonder if investing  in management so that they stick around for longer and develop knowledge and experience wouldn’t help both the quality of  the gym as well as the overall profitability.

No	White	Male	I’m the head route setter for a large facility that was making multiple millions per year pre-pandemic. I’ve been told multiple  times by various administrators about how proud they are of their employee payroll (they think they’re paying everyone more  than enough...). Employees (besides salaried employees, of which there are currently two) don’t get PTO, health insurance  coverage, and I’m almost certain there’s no sick leave for hourly employees. Salaried employees accrue PTO and sick leave  but that’s the only benefit other than pay. Could write a book on everything that I see wrong with the industry, but a starting point  would be paying route setters and head route setters more because they are creating the product that is making (or was making)  gym owners millionaires.

Upper management often don't stay for more than 2 years because they don't receive fair compensation for  the amount of work put into the job and are told to either have the same opinion as the owner or have no opinion at all.  All staff, regardless of position, are forced as a condition of employment to sign that they will not discuss their wages with  other staff and that they will not intentionally or unintentionally create dissonance within the staff.

In route setting, lifting things to heavy for me to handle, going behind the walls to fix spinners 		White	Female	Overall I've had a very good experience working in the climbing industry. I've been well supported by my direct supervisor (gym's gm) who has advocated on my behalf to upper management and is very supportive and flexible. If I didn't have such a good gm things would be much harder. I'm lucky to have a full time, salaried position. I routeset for 3 years and ultimately quit because of injuries and the general wear and tear on my body. Our gym has a hard time retaining good qualified employees because most of the opportunities are part time and pay minimum or just above, so they end up having to find other jobs. If gyms want to retain good employees management needs to figure out how to offer enough work to make a living on. Long term, I will likely eventually leave the climbing industry to work for myself and make more money.

I believe this is at least in part due to the high cost of running a climbing gym and the low profit margins. Especially in smaller climbing communities/cities. Staff training is an often overlooked/under applied part of onboarding new employees which leads to staff feeling overworked and overwhelmed and faster staff turnover. More up-front training would increase staff costs in the short term but would mean lower overall staff costs in the long run due to decreased turnover -> could mean higher wages for employees over time
